// Instead of importing the RootState and AppDispatch types into each component, itâ€™s recommended to create typed versions of the useDispatch and useSelector hooks. This helps avoid potential circular import dependency issues and makes it easier to use these hooks across your application.

import { TypedUseSelectorHook, useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { AppDispatch, RootState } from "./store";

export const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<AppDispatch>()
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector
